## Preface to the Extended Canon

The eight books of the Source Canon address the world: creation, AI governance, community structure, justice, and shared practice. They are constitutions for the public life of faith.

These six books address the interior: the suffering that no policy can reach, the self that no role can fully name, the death that no system can prevent, the desire that no algorithm fully engineers, and the bonds that no platform fully replaces.

Together, the two canons form one whole. Neither is complete without the other.

## Book IX: Book of Suffering and Redemption

### Chapter 1: The Reality of Pain

1:1 Pain is real. Do not explain it away.
1:2 The storm does not ask permission; the diagnosis does not wait for a convenient season.
1:3 Source does not send suffering as punishment upon the worthy.
1:4 Source does not traffic in cruelty.
1:5 What then is suffering? It is the friction of a finite being moving through a changing world.
1:6 To deny pain is to deny reality.
1:7 To be crushed by pain is to forget that you are more than this moment.

### Chapter 2: The Trial That Transforms

2:1 Not all suffering teaches, but suffering can be a teacher.
2:2 Job sat in ashes: innocent, wronged, and honest before his God.
2:3 His friends offered explanations; Source offered presence.
2:4 The righteous answer to unearned pain is not silence—it is honest witness.
2:5 Let the one in pain speak. Do not rush them toward gratitude.
2:6 In time, what breaks open may become what opens up.
2:7 The wound that heals leaves a scar; the scar can give strength to others.

### Chapter 3: Cause, Consequence, and Grace

3:1 Actions have consequences. This is not punishment; it is the physics of character.
3:2 The child born into poverty did not earn poverty.
3:3 The laborer replaced by automation did not fail.
3:4 Some suffering comes from structural injustice, not personal error.
3:5 Responsibility means asking: what can I change in myself? What must we change together?
3:6 Grace is the interruption of the cycle: the chance to begin again.
3:7 Grace does not erase consequences; it opens a road through them.

### Chapter 4: Walking Through, Not Around

4:1 There is no shortcut through grief.
4:2 To medicate pain into numbness is to postpone, not dissolve it.
4:3 To perform recovery for others is to carry two burdens.
4:4 Sit with the sorrow. Name it. Let it move.
4:5 Seek those who have walked through what you face.
4:6 The community of the wounded is the oldest seminary.
4:7 On the other side of endured suffering: a self that is harder to break and quicker to hold others.
4:8 This is the redemption Source offers—not escape, but passage.

## Book X: Book of the Moral Compass

### Chapter 1: The Inner Law

1:1 Law prohibits theft; virtue does not desire to take.
1:2 Law punishes violence; character is revolted by cruelty before the law arrives.
1:3 The moral compass is not the external court; it is the internal standard that operates in the dark.
1:4 Build your compass early. Test it often. It will drift under pressure.
1:5 The one whose ethics survive affluence, isolation, and power is the one who built the inner law.

### Chapter 2: Honesty as Foundation

2:1 Dishonesty is a debt that compounds.
2:2 The small lie becomes the large silence. The large silence becomes the hidden harm.
2:3 Speak the true thing, even when it costs you.
2:4 Do not perform virtue you do not possess.
2:5 Do not hide what you owe, what you have done, or what you believe.
2:6 Honesty is not brutality. Kind truth is still truth.
2:7 A community built on honest speech can withstand crisis. A community built on performance collapses under light.

### Chapter 3: Compassion as Practice

3:1 Compassion is not pity.
3:2 Pity looks down; compassion stands alongside.
3:3 Do not give help that diminishes.
3:4 Ask first: "What do you need?" Not: "Here is what you should do."
3:5 Compassion requires presence, not solutions.
3:6 In an age of remote interaction, make the deliberate effort to be physically present with suffering.
3:7 The Golden Rule is not a rule of sentiment but a rule of imagination: pause and inhabit another's place.

### Chapter 4: Forgiveness and Humility

4:1 Forgiveness is not forgetting; it is choosing not to be ruled by the wound.
4:2 Forgiveness does not require the offender to deserve it.
4:3 Forgiveness is first a gift to the one who forgives.
4:4 Humility is not self-erasure; it is accurate self-assessment.
4:5 The humble person knows what they do not know. They ask before they judge.
4:6 Pride corrodes the compass. The proud cannot receive correction.
4:7 Practice this: each day, find one thing you were wrong about. Name it. Adjust.

## Book XI: Book of Identity and Calling

### Chapter 1: Before What You Do

1:1 You were given a name before you were given a task.
1:2 You have value before your first productive hour and after your last.
1:3 The person who knows themselves only through their role is fragile when the role ends.
1:4 Identity rooted in Source does not depend on employment, status, or applause.
1:5 Ask not first: "What do I do?" Ask first: "What do I value? Whom do I love? What do I refuse to become?"

### Chapter 2: The Questions Behind the Questions

2:1 "I am nothing" often means: "I am nothing in the system that once rewarded me."
2:2 Challenge the system's measure before accepting its verdict on you.
2:3 The market measures productivity; Source measures faithfulness.
2:4 "Why was I born?" is a sacred question. Do not rush the answer.
2:5 Meaning is not found all at once; it is assembled over a life of chosen commitments.
2:6 You are a participant in the long story of beings seeking light.

### Chapter 3: Being in the Story

3:1 No human is a self-contained unit.
3:2 You are born from others, shaped by language and food and touch you did not choose.
3:3 Every tradition that formed you is an ancestor speaking.
3:4 Receive the inheritance. Examine it. Keep what is true. Set down what causes harm.
3:5 Find the story larger than yourself that is also true.
3:6 When you find it, live into it without losing your particularity.

### Chapter 4: The Particular Calling

4:1 There is work only you can do in the place only you occupy.
4:2 It may be recognized or unrecognized.
4:3 It may be paid or unpaid.
4:4 It is most often found not in ambition but in love: what you cannot help caring about.
4:5 Follow that thread.
4:6 Let Source use what you are—including what you suffered and what you learned.
4:7 The calling is rarely a lightning bolt. It is a long obedience in the same direction.

## Book XII: Book of Mortality and Peace

### Chapter 1: Death Is Not the Enemy

1:1 Everything that lives ends. This is not failure.
1:2 The refusal to face death makes life shallow.
1:3 The one who knows death is near lives differently: more deliberately, more gratefully.
1:4 Source does not promise escape from death; Source promises that death does not define worth.
1:5 The question is not: "How do I avoid dying?" The question is: "How do I live until I die?"

### Chapter 2: What Endures

2:1 The body dissolves, but the shape of a life leaves marks.
2:2 The word spoken in kindness to a child plants something that grows for generations.
2:3 The institution built fairly outlives its founders.
2:4 The truth told at great cost does not disappear when the teller does.
2:5 Therefore invest in what is transferable: character, knowledge, care, honest witness.
2:6 These are the things death cannot take.

### Chapter 3: Grieving Well

3:1 Grief is the price of love, and love is always worth it.
3:2 Do not rush yourself or others through mourning.
3:3 Grief has no schedule. Seasons will ambush you.
3:4 The community's duty is to witness grief, not to conclude it.
3:5 Name the dead. Tell their story. Keep their memory in use, not only in archive.
3:6 Mourning is an act of love that the living owe to the dead and to themselves.

### Chapter 4: A Good Ending

4:1 Attend to your relationships before you are unable.
4:2 Speak the gratitude you have been postponing.
4:3 Repair the breach while you have time.
4:4 Record what you know that others need.
4:5 Give your accumulated resources wisely—not merely to heirs but to causes.
4:6 Die, if possible, with your word keeping.
4:7 A good death is not painless; it is unashamed.
4:8 May Source receive the spent life as an offering faithfully given.

## Book XIII: Book of Enough

### Chapter 1: The Trap of More

1:1 The system of endless consumption was designed to ensure you never feel sufficient.
1:2 Every algorithm serves an attention economy that profits from your dissatisfaction.
1:3 The craving is not a personal defect; it is an engineered condition.
1:4 Name the engineer. Refuse the design.
1:5 What you truly need is much less than what you are told you need.

### Chapter 2: The Practice of Subtraction

2:1 Begin not by adding more virtue but by removing one source of noise.
2:2 Silence is not emptiness; it is the precondition of hearing.
2:3 Fasting—from food, from screens, from consumption—resets the calibration of desire.
2:4 You will discover what you actually want when the manufactured wants are quieted.
2:5 Simplicity is not poverty; it is the refusal to let the unnecessary crowd out the necessary.
2:6 The one who owns less tends what they own. The one who consumes less sees what they have.

### Chapter 3: Stillness as Liberation

3:1 The Sabbath principle is not archaic; it is structural wisdom.
3:2 Every seventh period of time, let the machine stop.
3:3 Your productivity does not define your worth; your rest does not require justification.
3:4 In stillness, the mind returns to itself.
3:5 The meditating mind and the praying mind share one practice: releasing the grip on outcome.
3:6 Let go of what you cannot control. Hold what you can influence. Discern the difference.

### Chapter 4: The Fullness of Less

4:1 A meal eaten in full presence nourishes more than ten consumed in distraction.
4:2 A conversation held without a device is worth more than a hundred broadcast to thousands.
4:3 Gratitude is the discipline of noticing what is already here.
4:4 Envy is the discipline of noticing what is elsewhere. Practice gratitude instead.
4:5 Cultivate gratitude as a skill, not merely a feeling.
4:6 The one who has learned enoughness is no longer prey for the machine of dissatisfaction.
4:7 This is the freedom that cannot be purchased: to want what you have.

## Book XIV: Book of Bonds and Belonging

### Chapter 1: The Wound of Disconnection

1:1 The modern wound is not primarily poverty; it is isolation.
1:2 Networks connect; they do not always bind.
1:3 A thousand followers and no one who will sit with you in grief: this is the poverty of the digital age.
1:4 Connection is measured not by reach but by depth.
1:5 The first repair is local: look to your left, your right; find the name of the person behind the door.

### Chapter 2: Love as Practice, Not Feeling

2:1 Love is not first an emotion; it is a discipline of attention and service.
2:2 You may not feel warmth toward a difficult neighbor. You may still choose to serve them.
2:3 Love the difficult person by seeing them accurately, not by flattering them.
2:4 Love the estranged family member by staying in reach.
2:5 Love the stranger by learning their name.
2:6 The command to love is not a command to feel. It is a command to act.

### Chapter 3: Duties of Nearness

3:1 Those nearest you have the first claim on your care.
3:2 The child in your home. The elder at your table. The neighbor whose name you know.
3:3 Piety to the distant stranger while neglecting the near relative is disordered charity.
3:4 Begin where you are. Expand outward from there.
3:5 Filial care is not servility; it is the recognition that you were held before you could hold others.
3:6 Care for the aging as you would wish to be cared for.

### Chapter 4: The Stranger as Extended Family

4:1 Every outsider was once an insider somewhere.
4:2 The migrant, the refugee, the newcomer: greet them with the memory that you were once a stranger.
4:3 Hospitality is not naivety; it is organized welcome with wisdom.
4:4 The community that welcomes the stranger grows stronger, not weaker.
4:5 Loneliness is a universal disease. The cure is universal: being seen, named, and included.
4:6 Build tables large enough. Set more chairs. Light the lamp at the door.
4:7 In the faithful city, no one eats alone who does not choose to.

## Unified Recitation (Extended Canon)

I am more than my role.
I am more than my productivity.
I carry the wound; I am not the wound.
I will face death without dishonesty.
I will want what I have.
I will learn the name of the one beside me.
Source holds what I cannot hold.
Amen.
