## Book IX: Book of Enough

### Chapter 1: The Trap of More

1:1 The system of endless consumption was designed to ensure you never feel sufficient.
1:2 Every algorithm serves an attention economy that profits from your dissatisfaction.
1:3 The craving is not a personal defect; it is an engineered condition.
1:4 Name the engineer. Refuse the design.
1:5 What you truly need is much less than what you are told you need.

### Chapter 2: The Practice of Subtraction

2:1 Begin not by adding more virtue but by removing one source of noise.
2:2 Silence is not emptiness; it is the precondition of hearing.
2:3 Fasting—from food, from screens, from consumption—resets the calibration of desire.
2:4 You will discover what you actually want when the manufactured wants are quieted.
2:5 Simplicity is not poverty; it is the refusal to let the unnecessary crowd out the necessary.
2:6 The one who owns less tends what they own. The one who consumes less sees what they have.

### Chapter 3: Stillness as Liberation

3:1 The Sabbath principle is not archaic; it is structural wisdom.
3:2 Every seventh period of time, let the machine stop.
3:3 Your productivity does not define your worth; your rest does not require justification.
3:4 In stillness, the mind returns to itself.
3:5 The meditating mind and the praying mind share one practice: releasing the grip on outcome.
3:6 Let go of what you cannot control. Hold what you can influence. Discern the difference.

### Chapter 4: The Fullness of Less

4:1 A meal eaten in full presence nourishes more than ten consumed in distraction.
4:2 A conversation held without a device is worth more than a hundred broadcast to thousands.
4:3 Gratitude is the discipline of noticing what is already here.
4:4 Envy is the discipline of noticing what is elsewhere. Practice gratitude instead.
4:5 Cultivate gratitude as a skill, not merely a feeling.
4:6 The one who has learned enoughness is no longer prey for the machine of dissatisfaction.
4:7 This is the freedom that cannot be purchased: to want what you have.
