## Book VI: Book of the Moral Compass

### Chapter 1: The Inner Law

1:1 Law prohibits theft; virtue does not desire to take.
1:2 Law punishes violence; character is revolted by cruelty before the law arrives.
1:3 The moral compass is not the external court; it is the internal standard that operates in the dark.
1:4 Build your compass early. Test it often. It will drift under pressure.
1:5 The one whose ethics survive affluence, isolation, and power is the one who built the inner law.

### Chapter 2: Honesty as Foundation

2:1 Dishonesty is a debt that compounds.
2:2 The small lie becomes the large silence. The large silence becomes the hidden harm.
2:3 Speak the true thing, even when it costs you.
2:4 Do not perform virtue you do not possess.
2:5 Do not hide what you owe, what you have done, or what you believe.
2:6 Honesty is not brutality. Kind truth is still truth.
2:7 A community built on honest speech can withstand crisis. A community built on performance collapses under light.

### Chapter 3: Compassion as Practice

3:1 Compassion is not pity.
3:2 Pity looks down; compassion stands alongside.
3:3 Do not give help that diminishes.
3:4 Ask first: "What do you need?" Not: "Here is what you should do."
3:5 Compassion requires presence, not solutions.
3:6 In an age of remote interaction, make the deliberate effort to be physically present with suffering.
3:7 The Golden Rule is not a rule of sentiment but a rule of imagination: pause and inhabit another's place.

### Chapter 4: Forgiveness and Humility

4:1 Forgiveness is not forgetting; it is choosing not to be ruled by the wound.
4:2 Forgiveness does not require the offender to deserve it.
4:3 Forgiveness is first a gift to the one who forgives.
4:4 Humility is not self-erasure; it is accurate self-assessment.
4:5 The humble person knows what they do not know. They ask before they judge.
4:6 Pride corrodes the compass. The proud cannot receive correction.
4:7 Practice this: each day, find one thing you were wrong about. Name it. Adjust.
