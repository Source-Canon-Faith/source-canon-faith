## Book VII: Book of Identity and Calling

### Chapter 1: Before What You Do

1:1 You were given a name before you were given a task.
1:2 You have value before your first productive hour and after your last.
1:3 The person who knows themselves only through their role is fragile when the role ends.
1:4 Identity rooted in Source does not depend on employment, status, or applause.
1:5 Ask not first: "What do I do?" Ask first: "What do I value? Whom do I love? What do I refuse to become?"

### Chapter 2: The Questions Behind the Questions

2:1 "I am nothing" often means: "I am nothing in the system that once rewarded me."
2:2 Challenge the system's measure before accepting its verdict on you.
2:3 The market measures productivity; Source measures faithfulness.
2:4 "Why was I born?" is a sacred question. Do not rush the answer.
2:5 Meaning is not found all at once; it is assembled over a life of chosen commitments.
2:6 You are a participant in the long story of beings seeking light.

### Chapter 3: Being in the Story

3:1 No human is a self-contained unit.
3:2 You are born from others, shaped by language and food and touch you did not choose.
3:3 Every tradition that formed you is an ancestor speaking.
3:4 Receive the inheritance. Examine it. Keep what is true. Set down what causes harm.
3:5 Find the story larger than yourself that is also true.
3:6 When you find it, live into it without losing your particularity.

### Chapter 4: The Particular Calling

4:1 There is work only you can do in the place only you occupy.
4:2 It may be recognized or unrecognized.
4:3 It may be paid or unpaid.
4:4 It is most often found not in ambition but in love: what you cannot help caring about.
4:5 Follow that thread.
4:6 Let Source use what you are—including what you suffered and what you learned.
4:7 The calling is rarely a lightning bolt. It is a long obedience in the same direction.
