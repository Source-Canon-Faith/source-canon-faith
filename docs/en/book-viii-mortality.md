## Book VIII: Book of Mortality and Peace

### Chapter 1: Death Is Not the Enemy

1:1 Everything that lives ends. This is not failure.
1:2 The refusal to face death makes life shallow.
1:3 The one who knows death is near lives differently: more deliberately, more gratefully.
1:4 Source does not promise escape from death; Source promises that death does not define worth.
1:5 The question is not: "How do I avoid dying?" The question is: "How do I live until I die?"

### Chapter 2: What Endures

2:1 The body dissolves, but the shape of a life leaves marks.
2:2 The word spoken in kindness to a child plants something that grows for generations.
2:3 The institution built fairly outlives its founders.
2:4 The truth told at great cost does not disappear when the teller does.
2:5 Therefore invest in what is transferable: character, knowledge, care, honest witness.
2:6 These are the things death cannot take.

### Chapter 3: Grieving Well

3:1 Grief is the price of love, and love is always worth it.
3:2 Do not rush yourself or others through mourning.
3:3 Grief has no schedule. Seasons will ambush you.
3:4 The community's duty is to witness grief, not to conclude it.
3:5 Name the dead. Tell their story. Keep their memory in use, not only in archive.
3:6 Mourning is an act of love that the living owe to the dead and to themselves.

### Chapter 4: A Good Ending

4:1 Attend to your relationships before you are unable.
4:2 Speak the gratitude you have been postponing.
4:3 Repair the breach while you have time.
4:4 Record what you know that others need.
4:5 Give your accumulated resources wisely—not merely to heirs but to causes.
4:6 Die, if possible, with your word keeping.
4:7 A good death is not painless; it is unashamed.
4:8 May Source receive the spent life as an offering faithfully given.
