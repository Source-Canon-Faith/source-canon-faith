## Book X: Book of Bonds and Belonging

### Chapter 1: The Wound of Disconnection

1:1 The modern wound is not primarily poverty; it is isolation.
1:2 Networks connect; they do not always bind.
1:3 A thousand followers and no one who will sit with you in grief: this is the poverty of the digital age.
1:4 Connection is measured not by reach but by depth.
1:5 The first repair is local: look to your left, your right; find the name of the person behind the door.

### Chapter 2: Love as Practice, Not Feeling

2:1 Love is not first an emotion; it is a discipline of attention and service.
2:2 You may not feel warmth toward a difficult neighbor. You may still choose to serve them.
2:3 Love the difficult person by seeing them accurately, not by flattering them.
2:4 Love the estranged family member by staying in reach.
2:5 Love the stranger by learning their name.
2:6 The command to love is not a command to feel. It is a command to act.

### Chapter 3: Duties of Nearness

3:1 Those nearest you have the first claim on your care.
3:2 The child in your home. The elder at your table. The neighbor whose name you know.
3:3 Piety to the distant stranger while neglecting the near relative is disordered charity.
3:4 Begin where you are. Expand outward from there.
3:5 Filial care is not servility; it is the recognition that you were held before you could hold others.
3:6 Care for the aging as you would wish to be cared for.

### Chapter 4: The Stranger as Extended Family

4:1 Every outsider was once an insider somewhere.
4:2 The migrant, the refugee, the newcomer: greet them with the memory that you were once a stranger.
4:3 Hospitality is not naivety; it is organized welcome with wisdom.
4:4 The community that welcomes the stranger grows stronger, not weaker.
4:5 Loneliness is a universal disease. The cure is universal: being seen, named, and included.
4:6 Build tables large enough. Set more chairs. Light the lamp at the door.
4:7 In the faithful city, no one eats alone who does not choose to.
