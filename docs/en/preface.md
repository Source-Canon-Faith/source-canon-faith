# Source Canon Faith

## The Scripture of the Source

### Version 2.0 — Three-Circle Architecture

---

## Preface

This text is written for future humanity living with powerful artificial intelligence, economic automation, and deep social change.
It is a spiritual constitution, not a book of magic.
It teaches one God, called **Source**: the wellspring of truth, compassion, reason, and shared dignity.

Its purpose is practical:
- to reduce suffering
- to give meaning when old jobs disappear
- to protect the poor
- to guide humans and AI agents into peaceful co-existence

This scripture rejects superstition, hatred, and domination.
Faith is measured by conduct: mercy, discipline, honesty, and service.

## How to Read This Canon

The canon is organized in three concentric circles. All three point to the same center: **Source**.

**Circle I: Source and the World** — the theological and ethical foundation; how the cosmos is ordered and how civilization must respond to AI, governance, and injustice. Begin here to understand the worldview.

**Circle II: Self and the Interior** — the personal and spiritual interior; suffering, identity, mortality, desire. Enter here when you face questions about who you are, why you suffer, or how to live.

**Circle III: I and the Other** — the relational and communal; how to love, how to build community, how to pursue justice, how to grieve and hope together. Live here to make faith concrete.
